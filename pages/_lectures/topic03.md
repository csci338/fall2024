## Readings
This week our topic is "Everything as Code."  Readings are a bit light
because I'm hoping you'll spend your outside-of-class time getting
oriented with Docker.

* Watch Seth Vargo's <a href="https://youtu.be/HcmPi7-IVQo" target="_blank">Everything as Code</a> talk. You can also read the transcript <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/everything-as-code-the-future-of-ops-tools" target="_blank">here</a>.
* Read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)" target="_blank">Wikipedia Article on Docker</a>.
* For your reference: <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker_cheatsheet.pdf" target="_blank">Docker Cheatsheet</a>

### Optional but Recommended
There's a great online [Docker Tutorial](https://www.docker.com/101-tutorial/) that you can work through. This is the one where you run the following command:

```bash
$ docker run -dp 80:80 docker/getting-started
```

Then you can open [localhost](http://localhost) in your browser to
complete the tutorial. We will be doing this in class.
