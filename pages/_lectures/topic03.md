## Readings
This week our topic is "Everything as Code."  Readings are a bit light
because I'm hoping you'll spend your outside-of-class time getting
oriented with Docker.

* Watch Seth Vargo's [Everything as Code](https://youtu.be/HcmPi7-IVQo) talk. You can also read the transcript [here](https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/everything-as-code-the-future-of-ops-tools).
* Read the [Wikipedia Article on Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)).


### Optional but Recommended
There's a great online [Docker Tutorial](https://www.docker.com/101-tutorial/) that you can work through. This is the one where you run the following command:

```bash
$ docker run -dp 80:80 docker/getting-started
```

Then you can open [localhost](http://localhost) in your browser to
complete the tutorial.
