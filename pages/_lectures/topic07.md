In this unit, we're going to explore some software engineering ideas that are specific to client-side engineering. To do this, we're going to learn some HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React concepts ***as a means of learning*** various client-side SWE principles (starting with [Lab 6](../assignments/lab06)).

Please complete the assigned readings for this unit, as they provide a nice overview of the client-side considerations and challenges we'll be exploring.
